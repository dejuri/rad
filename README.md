# rad

rad is a source-based package manager for Radrix GNU/Linux or other GNU/Linux distros, usually LFS.

rad is an abbreviation for Rathrix Automated TOML-packages Header

but when it combines with Slavic God Radogost, who is the God of trade and seafaring,
even easier to call it just rad.

It stays for managing system packages, user ones is better to manage with [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) or other
